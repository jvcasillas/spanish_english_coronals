{One
of
the
assumptions
of
this
type
of
model
is
that
the
predictors
cannot
be
intercorrelated.
If,
for
example,
predictor
X
and
predictor
Y
were
correlated,
the
relationship
was
orthogonalized
by
taking
the
residuals
of
a
linear
model
in
which
X
predicted
Y
and
using
them
as
the
predictor
in
the
main
binomial
regression.}}
