	Abstract = {The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. The presentation of variance explained' (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.},

@article{forrest1990statistical,
	Abstract = {The acoustic characteristics of voiceless velar and alveolar stop consonants were investigated for normally articulating and phonologically disordered children using spectral moments. All the disordered children were perceived to produce /t/ for /k/, with /k/ being absent from their phonetic inventories. Approximately 82% of the normally articulating children's consonants were classified correctly by discriminant function analysis, on the basis of the mean (first moment), skewness (third moment) and kurtosis (fourth moment) derived from the first 40 ms of the VOT interval. When the discriminant function developed for the normally articulating children was applied to the speech of the phonologically disordered group of children, no distinction was made between the velar and alveolar stops. Application of the model to the speech of individual children in the disordered group revealed that one child produced distinct markings to the velar-alveolar contrast. Variability measures of target /t/ and /k/ utterances indicated greater variability in this disordered child's productions compared with the normally articulating children. Phonological analysis of this child's speech after treatment, in which the velar-alveolar contrast was not treated, revealed target appropriate productions of both /t/ and /k/. By contrast, the other three phonologically disordered children, for whom no acoustic distinction was found between target /t/ and target /k/, did not evidence any knowledge of the contrast after treatment with other target phonemes.

	Abstract = {A statistical procedure for classifying word‐initial voiceless obstruents is described. The data set to which the analysis was applied consisted of monosyllabic words starting with a voiceless obstruent. Each word was repeated six times in the carrier phrase ``I can say ------ , again'' by each of ten speakers. Fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), using a 20‐ms Hamming window, were calculated every 10 ms from the onset of the obstruent through the third cycle of the following vowel. Each FFT was treated as a random probability distribution from which the first four moments (mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) were computed. Moments were calculated from linear and Bark transformed spectra. Data were pooled across vowel contexts for speakers of a given gender and input to a discriminant analysis. Using the moments calculated from the linear spectra, 92% of the voiceless stops were classified correctly when dynamic aspects of the stop were included. Even more important, the model constructed from the males' data correctly classified about 94% of the voiceless stops produced by the female speakers. Classification of the voiceless fricatives when all places of articulation were included in the analysis did not exceed 80% correct when the moments from either the linear or Bark transformed scales were used. However, classification of only the voiceless sibilants was 98% correct when the moments from the Bark transformed spectra were used. As with the stops, the classification model held across gender.},

	Abstract = {As part of an ongoing study of talker‐specific speech processing, we sought to document the existence of individual talker differences in voice‐onset‐time (VOT). Four female and four male talkers, all native speakers of American English, were asked to produce 30 repetitions each of 18 different words beginning with /p/, /t/, or /k/. Words were displayed visually on a computer monitor one at a time in a randomized order at a constant presentation rate, and talkers were asked to produce the words at a comfortable speaking rate. The VOT and duration of each spoken word were measured. The eight talkers showed substantial individual variation in speaking rate (as measured by word duration) and, as would be expected, slower speaking rates were associated with longer VOT values. In order to determine whether there were individual differences in VOT beyond those associated with speaking rate, we conducted analyses that controlled for speaking rate on a word‐by‐word basis. These analyses revealed cases of consistent individual differences in VOT. We are currently examining whether the structure of listeners' perceptual voicing categories reflects such individual talker differences. },

The acoustic attributes of the consonants were systematically manipulated, the selection of stimulus characteristics being guided in part by theoretical considerations concerning the expected properties of the soundgenerated in the vocal tract as place of articulation is varied. Several stimulus series were generated with and without noise bursts at the onset, and with and without formant transitions following consonantal release. Stimuli with transitions only, and with bursts plus transitions, were consistently classified according to place of articulation, whereas stimuli with bursts only and no transitions were not consistently identified. The acoustic attributes of the stimuli were examined to determine whether invariant properties characterized each place of atriculation independent of vowel context. It was determined that the gross shape of the spectrum sampled at the consonantal release showed a distinctive shape for each place of articulation: a prominent midfrequency spectral peak for velars, a diffuse‐rising spectrum for alveolars, and a diffuse‐falling spectrum for labials. These attributes are evident for stimuli containing transitions only, but are enhanced by the presence of noise bursts at the onset.},

	Abstract = {This study reports on an investigation into the voice onset time (VOT) patterns of the plosives /p b t d/ in a group of 30 children aged 7 (n = 10), 9 (n = 10) and 11 (n = 10) years. Equal numbers of girls and boys participated in the study. Each child named a series of letter objects to elicit /p b t d/ in a syllable onset position with a fixed vowel context. VOT data were examined for age, sex and plosive differences with the following hypotheses: Firstly, that there would be sex differences in the VOT patterns of preadolescent children. Secondly, that the sex differences in VOT patterns would be linked to age and development, and that these would eventually become marked by the age of 11 years, by which time adult-like VOT values should have been achieved. Finally, that the extent of sex and age differences would be dependent upon the plosive being investigated. Results indicated patterns of decrease with age in the VOT values of /p b/ for the boys, with some evidence of increases in the VOT values of /t/ for the girls. In addition, 'voiced' and 'voiceless' cognates showed a more marked bimodal distribution in the girls' VOT patterns. This bimodal distribution was investigated by examining the degree of difference between the VOT values of voiced and voiceless cognate pairs /p b/ and /t d/, and examining the effects of age, sex and cognate pair. These results indicated that more marked sex differences in the 'voiced'/'voiceless' contrast emerged between the data of the 9- and 11-year-olds, a pattern, which was more marked for the alveolar plosives. These preliminary results confirmed all three hypotheses. The findings are presented and discussed both within a developmental and sociophonetic framework.},

	Abstract = {This study describes English-speaking children's acquisition of voice onset time (VOT), a segmental feature that specifies the timing of word-initial stop consonants, and final-syllable vowel lengthening (FSVL), a suprasegmental feature that influences the timing of vowels. The purpose of the study was to evaluate two hypotheses about the acquisition of speech timing contrasts: a `motoric' hypothesis predicting that children would control the vowel duration contrast earlier than the consonantal one (FSVL before VOT), and a `representation' hypothesis predicting that children would control the contrast represented on the segmental level of linguistic description earlier than the contrast represented on the suprasegmental level (VOT before FSVL). Longitudinal acquisition patterns for both contrasts were compared in ten children between the mean ages of 1;6 and 2;0. The results, indicating that English-speaking children usually acquired VOT before FSVL, are discussed in light of evidence that French-speaking children acquire analogous contrasts in the opposite sequence. The crosslanguage comparisons support limited forms of both the motoric and representation hypotheses. As promising topics for further study, the results also suggested the importance of individual differences, and the variability of timing features in the input.},

The speaking rate changes exerted less effect on the VOT in stops spoken by the Spanish than the English monolinguals. Moreover, whereas English monolinguals produced /p, t/ (with shorter VOT at a fast than at a normal rate, many Spanish monolinguals showed a trend in the opposite direction. As expected, all 10 early bilinguals produced English stops with VOT values that were similar to the English monolinguals. They also showed speaking rate effects on VOT that were similar to those observed for the English monolinguals. The late bilinguals, who had begun learning English as adults, showed smaller effects of speaking rate on VOT than did the English monolinguals. Their mean VOT values for English stops spanned a wide range of values. Just 3 of the late bilinguals produced English stops with VOT values that fell within the range of values observed for the English monolinguals.},

	Abstract = {Of interest in the current study was how voice inset time (VOT) was influenced by changes in speaking rate across Spanish and English. Three groups of subjects (English monolinguals, Spanish monolinguals and early Spanish-English bilinguals) produced sentences containing voiced and voiceless bilabial stops at different speaking rates. As in previous research, English monolinguals showed rate-dependent effects on their VOT productions: VOT increased as speaking rate decreased. Spanish monolinguals showed a large effect of speaking rate on the duration of prevoicing of the voiced stops. However, they showed only a small effect of rate on the VOT of their voiceless stops. The bilinguals produced VOT values in each language that were nearly identical to their monolingual counterparts. The results from this study indicate that short-lag stops experience minimal variation as a function of speaking rate regardless of the other contrasting phonetic categories within a particular language. In addition, early bilinguals showed evidence of separate representations for voiced and voiceless stops for English and Spanish.},

	Abstract = {The voice onset time (VOT) and the duration of the burst of frication noise at the release of a plosive consonant were measured from spectrograms of word-initial consonant clusters. Mean data from three speakers reading English words in a sentence frame indicated that the VOT changed as a function of the place of articulation of the plosive and as a function of the identity of the following vowel or sonorant consonant. Burst durations varied in a similar way such that the remaining interval of aspiration in /p, t, k/ was nearly the same duration in comparable phonetic environments. The VOT was longer before sonorants and high vowels than before mid- and low vowels. Aspiration was also seen in an /s/-sonorant cluster. To explain these regularities, production strategies and perceptual cues to a voicing decision for English plosives are considered. Variations in VOT are explained in terms of articulatory mechanisms, perceptual constraints, and phonological rules. Some VOT data obtained from a connected discourse were also analyzed and organized into a set of rules for predicting voice onset time in any sentence context.},

	Abstract = {The American English stops /b/, /d/, and /g/ are produced with negative VOT (−150--0 ms) or short‐lag VOT (0--30 ms). These two variants have been shown to occur with approximately equal frequency across speakers, although individual preferences are common. It has been hypothesized that the characteristic VOTs of short‐lag stops are determined by relatively simpler articulatory control mechanisms than negative VOT variants. Specifically, if the vocal folds are approximated prior to constriction release, and intraoral pressure is vented only at the point of maximum constriction (without supraglottal expansion), the VOT will be determined by the venting process controlled by the time‐varying constriction aperture. Thus, the release kinematics could account for effects of place of articulation and vowel context on short‐lag VOTs. In the current work, the plausibility of this hypothesis is evaluated. The kinematics of constriction release gestures was examined from x‐ray microbeam data. Descriptions of the time‐varying geometries of constriction releases were input to a simple model of breath‐stream dynamics and simulated VOT values were obtained. The descriptive and simulated data are consistent with the hypothesis that the characteristic durations of short‐lag VOTs are determined by the venting process controlled by the supraglottal stop release gesture.},

	Abstract = {Several studies have shown that the voice onset time (VOT) of English stops varies as a function of speaker gender. The overall trend indicates that females exhibit larger \{VOT\} values than males for long-lag stops. Previous studies have mainly attributed this difference to physiological differences between the genders. If this were the case, we would expect to find identical gender differences in the \{VOTs\} of long-lag stops in other languages. Thirty-eight native speakers of Korean (19 males and 19 females) produced fortis, lenis, and aspirated stops in /CVn/ words both in isolation and in a carrier sentence. On average, the males exhibited longer \{VOTs\} than the females for the aspirated stops, and the differences were statistically significant in both utterance types. This result indicates that the physiological explanations previously proposed are not tenable since there is no inherent reason why \{VOT\} values for the long-lag stops are longer for females in English, but longer for males in Korean. Also, the males in this experiment exhibited more distinctive distributions in \{VOT\} values between lenis and aspirated stops than the females. It was suggested that sociophonetic factors may explain why different languages can exhibit opposing trends in temporal acoustic features such as \{VOTs\} based on gender differences. },

Schouten and van Hessen [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 104, 2980--2990 (1998)] explicitly tested this assumption for an intensity continuum and a speech continuum. They measured response distributions directly and, assuming an interval scale, concluded that the Gaussian assumption held for both continua. However, Pastore and Macmillan [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 111, 2432 (2002)] applied ROC analysis to Schouten and van Hessen's data, assuming only an ordinal scale. Their ROC curves suppported the Gaussian assumption for the nonspeech signals only. Previously, Lopez‐Bascuas [Proc. Audit. Bas. Speech Percept., 158--161 (1997)] found evidence with a rating scale procedure that the Gaussian model was inadequate for a voice‐onset time continuum but not for a noise‐buzz continuum. Both continua contained ten stimuli with asynchronies ranging from −35 ms to +55 ms. ROC curves (double‐probability plots) are now reported for each pair of adjacent stimuli on the two continua.

	Notes = {Previous studies have employed signal detection theory to analyze data from speech and nonspeech experiments. Typically, signal distributions were assumed to be Gaussian. Schouten and van Hessen [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 104, 2980--2990 (1998)] explicitly tested this assumption for an intensity continuum and a speech continuum. They measured response distributions directly and, assuming an interval scale, concluded that the Gaussian assumption held for both continua. However, Pastore and Macmillan [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 111, 2432 (2002)] applied ROC analysis to Schouten and van Hessen's data, assuming only an ordinal scale. Their ROC curves suppported the Gaussian assumption for the nonspeech signals only. Previously, Lopez‐Bascuas [Proc. Audit. Bas. Speech Percept., 158--161 (1997)] found evidence with a rating scale procedure that the Gaussian model was inadequate for a voice‐onset time continuum but not for a noise‐buzz continuum. Both continua contained ten stimuli with asynchronies ranging from −35 ms to +55 ms. ROC curves (double‐probability plots) are now reported for each pair of adjacent stimuli on the two continua. Both speech and nonspeech ROCs often appeared nonlinear, indicating non‐Gaussian signal distributions under the usual zero‐variance assumption for response criteria.},

	Abstract = {Lisker and Abramson [Word 20, 384‐422 (1964)] showed that voice onset time (VOT) for word‐initial stops labeled as voiced and voiceless differ across languages, thus demonstrating that VOT is learned. Over the years, several studies have examined the developmental course of acquiring VOT for several languages, but questions remain regarding the time course of this development. Earlier studies of VOT acquisition have demonstrated that English learning infants initially produce stops with short‐lag VOTs only, then go through a stage of ambiguous VOTs, finally developing two mature categories of voiced and voiceless. This study analyzed mean VOT and variability in word‐initial stops produced in spontaneous samples by three infants, taped at approximately 2‐month intervals between the ages of 12 months and 30 months. As predicted, these infants produced primarily voiced stops (VOT<40 ms) with moderate variability until approximately 21 months. Then longer lag stops began to appear and variability increased. Outliers (both voiced stops with extreme prevoicing and very long lag voiceless stops) were found. By the last recording session, all three infants showed mean voiced and voiceless VOTs approaching adult values, but still exhibited greater variability.
