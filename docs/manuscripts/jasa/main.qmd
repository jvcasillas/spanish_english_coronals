# Method

## Participants

The data include `r exp_n` participants from 3 populations: monolingual English speakers, monolingual Spanish speakers, and bilingual Spanish-English speakers.
All participants were females between the ages of 18 and 23.
The monolingual English speakers were recorded in English and the monolingual Spanish speakers were recorded in Spanish.
The Spanish-English bilinguals were recorded in both of their languages.

**Monolingual English speakers.** The study includes `r mono_en_n` monolingual English speakers.
They were undergraduate students at the University of Arizona, born and raised in the US Southwest.
The English speakers were functionally monolingual, though they reported having taken introductory Spanish courses.
They were not able to maintain a basic conversation in Spanish.
All of the participants in this group reported English as their native language and verified not having been exposed to any other languages while growing up.

**Monolingual Spanish speakers.** The monolingual Spanish group comprised `r mono_sp_n` speakers that were recruited from the *Universitat de les Illes Balears* campus community and were born and raised on the island of Majorca, Spain.
They reported that, although they had studied some English in Spain, they were not able to maintain a basic conversation in this language.
The participants of this group also speak Catalan.
Importantly, there are no reported differences in the phonetic realization of voice timing between the Spanish and Catalan, nor are there place difference between the coronal stops.

**Bilingual speakers.** The Spanish-English bilinguals (n = `r bi_coronals_n + bi_poa_n`) came from Southern Arizona and Northern Mexico.
There are two samples from this population.
The coronal dataset includes `r bi_coronals_n` speakers and the bilabial dataset includes `r bi_poa_n` speakers.
The Spanish-English bilinguals were undergraduate students at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona.
The bilinguals were brought up by Spanish-speaking families and were schooled mostly in English.
They reported using English and Spanish daily, both in the classroom as well as with their friends and relatives.

The bilingual group completed the Bilingual Language Profile [BLP, @Gertken:2014wj] in order to assess language dominance.
The BLP calculates a weighted average of language dominance based on the individual history, use, proficiency, and attitudes of the bilinguals with regard to their languages.
The measure ranges from −218 to 218 with values near the extremes implying dominance in one of the languages.
Values close to 0 are taken as an indication of balanced bilingualism.
In the present study, Spanish was arbitrarily assigned to positive values.
Figure XXX plots language dominance (Panel A) and language use and proficiency data (Panel B) derived from the BLP.
The bilingual group had a mean dominance score of X (SD = X), suggesting rather balanced bilingualism (Panel A).
Participants that reported using Spanish more often also tended to report being more proficient in that language; the converse was also true for English (Panel B).

## Materials

INCLUDE INFO FROM ALDRICH's STUDY\
There were `r n_coronal_items` target words (English: k = `r n_coronal_items_en`; Spanish: k = `r n_coronal_items_sp`) that contained voiced and voiceless coronal stops in word initial position.
For each language, 12 targets began with /d/ and 12 began with /t/, equally divided between stressed and unstressed syllables (see supplementary materials).
All stops were followed by a low vowel (/a/ for Spanish and /æ, ɑ/ for English).

The participants completed a delayed repetition task in which they heard the target words presented in a carrier phrase ("*x is the word*" or the Spanish equivalent "*x es la palabra*").
The auditory stimuli were recordings of 6 male native speakers: 3 native English speakers and 3 native Spanish speakers.
These recordings served as the auditory stimuli repeated outloud by the participants in the delayed repetition task.
Words not containing coronal stops were considered distractors (k = 20).
Praat @praat was used to present the sentences randomly in auditory form and the speakers were asked to listen to the entire sentence and then repeat it outloud at their own pace.

The monolingual English speakers and bilinguals were recorded in a sound attenuated booth.
The monolingual Spanish speakers were recorded in a quiet classroom on the campus of the *Universitat de les Illes Balears* in Majorca, Spain.
The monolingual English speakers were recorded in English and the monolingual Spanish speakers were recorded in Spanish.
The Spanish-English bilinguals were recorded in both of their languages in a single session with all English and Spanish items presented in a single, randomized block.
The full dataset included `r n_coronal_tokens` tokens (24 target words per language &times; 3 repetitions).
`r xfun::numbers_to_words(3) %>% str_to_sentence` items (`r 3`%) were discarded due to mispronunciations or extraneous noise.
<!-- do this --> A Shure SM10A dynamic head-mounted microphone with a Sound Devices MM-1 microphone pre-amplifier captured the acoustic signal and it was saved to a Marantz PMD660 digital speech recorder.
The signal was digitized at 44.1 kHz and 16-bit quantization.

## Metrics

The audio files were low-pass filtered at 11.025 kHz.
Synchronized waveform and spectrographic displays were used to mark the onset of modal voicing and of the stop burst, as well as the offset of the first vowel.
The onset of voicing was operationalized as the upwards zero-crossing of the first periodic pattern in the oscillogram and the offset of the vowel was marked at the downwards zero-crossing of the final periodic pattern.
VOT was calculated as the difference (in ms) between the onset of modal voicing and the onset of the burst.
Spectral moment measures were calculated from a 6 ms window beginning at the onset of the burst.
Specifically, we extracted relative center of gravity, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, as well as F1 and F2 of the following vowel and relative intensity.

## Procedure

Decide if we will present 3 separate experiments with 3 different methods sections.

## Statistical analyses

All analyses were conducted in `R` [@R-base, `r r_version`].
We use Bayesian multilevel models fitted in `Stan` using `brms` [@R-brms_a; @R-brms_b, `r brms_version`].
Bayesian Data Analysis (BDA) is an alternative to frequentist statistical analysis.[^1]
For all models, the criterion was standardized, or converted to z-scores, in order to facilitate comparability between metrics.
Continuous predictors were also standardized and categorical predictors were sum-to-zero coded.
Thus for all models the intercept represents the outcome variable at the grand mean in standardized units.
We used regularizing, weakly informative priors in all models (specifics below) with 4,000 iterations (2,000 warm-up) running on 16 processing cores.
We quantify our uncertainty regarding a given effect by reporting point estimates derived from the posterior predictive distribution, including the 95% Highest Density Credible Intervals (HDI).
Additionally, we assume a negligible effect size of ±0.1 [@cohen1988statistical; @cohen2013statistical; @kruschke2018rejecting] in order to establish a Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE), for which we assess the proportion of the HDI that falls within this interval.
Finally, we report the Maximum Probability of Effect (MPE), or the Probability of Direction, as the proportion of the posterior distribution that is of the median's sign.
We assume there to be compelling evidence for a given effect when the HDI of the posterior distribution does not contain 0 nor fall within the ROPE by a reasonable margin and the MPE is close to 1.

# Results

The results are divided into 3 subsections dealing with (1) monolingual data, (2) bilingual data, and (3) POA data.
Each subsection presents the results of 6 metrics: VOT, relative intensity, center of gravity, kurtosis, standard deviation, and skewness.
We report only relevant effects.
Please see the supplementary materials (Appendices A-D) for complete model summaries.

## Experiment 1: Monolinguals

We modeled VOT and the burst metrics as a function of language (English, Spanish), phoneme (/d/, /t/), standardized F1 and F2, and item repetitions.
The model used regularizing, weakly informative priors [@Gelman_2017; @vasishth2018bayesian].
Specifically, all parameters were assumed to be distributed as normal with a standard deviation of 5, i.e., $Normal(\mu = 0$, $\sigma = 5)$.
The standard deviation parameters for random effects and the model residual error (sigma) were truncated to exclude negative values.
@fig-monolinguals plots VOT and the burst metrics as a function of language (English, Spanish) and phoneme (/d/, /t/).
For all plots the y-axis represents the outcome variable in standardized units.
The x-axis indicates the language and voiced/voiceless pairs are represented by color.

**Voice-onset time.** English stops had higher VOT than Spanish stops `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language", metric = "VOT")` and the voiceless segments had higher VOT than the voiced segments `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Phoneme", metric = "VOT")`.
We also find moderate evidence for an interaction between the two predictors `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language:Phoneme", metric = "VOT")`.
Specifically, the voicing difference between Spanish coronals was slightly larger than that of the English coronals.
We compared the short-lag stops of each language, English /d/ and Spanish /t/, and found no evidence that the segments differed from each other `r report_posterior(post_hoc, param = "mono_dt_between", metric = "VOT")`, as nearly half the HDI fell within the predetermined region of practical equivalence.
The VOT data is plotted in the first panel of @fig-monolinguals.
The complete model summary and the short-lag stop comparison are available in @tbl-mono and @fig-monolinguals-d-t of the supplementary materials.

**Relative intensity.** The relative intensity data is plotted in the top middle panel of @fig-monolinguals.
English and Spanish stops differed little with regard to relative intensity.
The model provided no compelling evidence for a group effect `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language", metric = "RI")`, nor for phoneme `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Phoneme", metric = "RI")` or F2 effects `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "F2", metric = "RI")`.
The height of the following vowel did appear to modulate relative intensity of the burst to some degree `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "F1", metric = "RI")`, such that higher F1 values were associated with lower relative intensity.
That being said, approximately `r filter(mono_table, Metric == "RI", identifier == "RI_F1") %>% pull(ROPE) * 100`% of the HDI fell within the region of practical equivalence.
Finally, there was no evidence supporting a language &times; phoneme interaction `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language:Phoneme", metric = "RI")`.

**Center of gravity.** The center of gravity (COG) data is plotted in the first row, third panel of @fig-monolinguals.
English stops had a higher COG than Spanish stops `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language", metric = "COG")`, and, overall, voiceless segments had a higher COG than the voiced segments `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Phoneme", metric = "COG")`, however, the two predictors interacted `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language:Phoneme", metric = "COG")`.
The interaction was driven by a large COG difference between Spanish coronals `r report_posterior(prefix = "Spanish /d/ vs. Spanish /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "mono_dt_win_lang", metric = "SPANISH_COG")` that was not present in the English coronals `r report_posterior(prefix = "English /d/ vs. English /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "mono_dt_win_lang", metric = "ENGLISH_COG")`).
No other predictors had an effect on COG.

**Kurtosis.** The kurtosis data is plotted in the second row, first column of @fig-monolinguals.
English stop bursts had lower kurtosis with regard to Spanish stop bursts `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language", metric = "KT")`, and the voiced segments presumably had a higher kurtosis than the voiceless segments `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Phoneme", metric = "KT")`, though there was evidence of a language &times; phoneme interaction `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language:Phoneme", metric = "KT")`.
Specifically, kurtosis was higher in the voiced stop bursts of Spanish `r report_posterior(prefix = "Spanish /d/ vs. Spanish /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "mono_dt_win_lang", metric = "SPANISH_KT")`, but there was no evidence of a voicing difference in the English data `r report_posterior(prefix = "English /d/ vs. English /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "mono_dt_win_lang", metric = "ENGLISH_KT")`.
Neither F1 `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "F1", metric = "KT")` nor F2 `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "F2", metric = "KT")` had any influence on kurtosis.

**Standard deviation.** With regard to standard deviation, we observe the same pattern found in the COG data (See third panel, first row and second panel, second row in @fig-monolinguals).
That is, there was a difference between English and Spanish `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language", metric = "SD")`, as well as between phonemes `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Phoneme", metric = "SD")`, though, again, there two predictors interacted `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language:Phoneme", metric = "SD")`.
Specifically, there was only a voicing difference for Spanish `r report_posterior(prefix = "Spanish /d/ vs. Spanish /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "mono_dt_win_lang", metric = "SPANISH_SD")`, where we see lower standard deviation values in voiced stops.
No such difference is observed between the English coronals `r report_posterior(prefix = "English /d/ vs. English /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "mono_dt_win_lang", metric = "ENGLISH_SD")`.
Height and frontedness of the following vowel had no effect on standard deviation in the stop burst (`r report_posterior(prefix = "F1: ", mono_table, param = "F1", metric = "SD", supress = T)``r report_posterior(prefix = "; F2: ", mono_table, param = "F2", metric = "SD", supress = T)`).

**Skewness.** The analysis of skewness of the stop burst showed a similar pattern as the one observed in the analysis of kurtosis.
If we compare the first and third panels (second row) of @fig-monolinguals, we observe a language effect `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language", metric = "SK")`, such that Spanish stops show higher skewness values, as well a voicing effect `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Phoneme", metric = "SK")`, which is driven by a language &times; phoneme interaction `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language:Phoneme", metric = "SK")`.
Specifically, the Spanish voiced coronal had higher skewness of the burst than the voiceless counterpart `r report_posterior(prefix = "Spanish /d/ vs. Spanish /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "mono_dt_win_lang", metric = "SPANISH_SK")`, and this difference is not present in the English data `r report_posterior(prefix = "English /d/ vs. English /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "mono_dt_win_lang", metric = "ENGLISH_SK")`.
Again, F1 and F2 did not affect skewness values in the burst (`r report_posterior(prefix = "F1: ", mono_table, param = "F1", metric = "SK", supress = T)``r report_posterior(prefix = "; F2: ", mono_table, param = "F2", metric = "SK", supress = T)`).

```

**Interim discussion.**

The analyses of the monolingual coronal stops are summarized in the forest plot in @fig-monolinguals-summary and @tbl-mono of the supplementary materials. 
Unsurprisingly, VOT was realized in a language-specific manner. 
Spanish voiced and voiceless stops were produced with lead-VOT and short-lag VOT, respectively; English voiced and voiceless stops were produced with short-lag VOT and long-lag VOT, respectively. 
Relative intensity did not distinguish between voicing contrasts in either language. 
Spectral moments, on the other hand, were particularly useful for Spanish coronals, with skewness and kurtosis patterning similarly, as did COG and standard deviation. 

## Experiment 2: Bilinguals

For the analysis of the bilingual coronal data, we again modeled VOT and the burst metrics as a function of language (English, Spanish), phoneme (/d/, /t/), standardized F1 and F2, and item repetitions. 
In other words, we carried out the same analysis using data from bilingual individuals. 
In this case, however, the fixed effect *language* is a within-subjects factor. 
That is, the bilinguals provided data from each of their two languages. 
@fig-bilinguals plots VOT and the burst metrics as a function of language (English, Spanish) and phoneme (/d/, /t/).
For all plots, the y-axis represents the outcome variable in standardized units, the x-axis indicates the language, and voicing is represented by color.

#| fig-cap: "Posterior medians ±95% and 66% credible intervals for VOT and burst metrics of bilingual voiceless bilabial and coronal stops. Individual point shapes and colors represent the six metrics analyzed. In this analysis, 'Place' refers to a between-participants comparison, as the bilabial data comes from a separate group of bilingual individuals."
