# Method

## Participants

The data include `r exp_n` participants from 3 populations: monolingual English speakers, monolingual Spanish speakers, and bilingual Spanish-English speakers.
All participants were females between the ages of 18 and 23.
The monolingual English speakers were recorded in English and the monolingual Spanish speakers were recorded in Spanish.
The Spanish-English bilinguals were recorded in both of their languages.

**Monolingual English speakers.** The study includes `r mono_en_n` monolingual English speakers.
They were undergraduate students at the University of Arizona, born and raised in the US Southwest.
The English speakers were functionally monolingual, though they reported having taken introductory Spanish courses.
They were not able to maintain a basic conversation in Spanish.
All of the participants in this group reported English as their native language and verified not having been exposed to any other languages while growing up.

**Monolingual Spanish speakers.** The monolingual Spanish group comprised `r mono_sp_n` speakers that were recruited from the *Universitat de les Illes Balears* campus community and were born and raised on the island of Majorca, Spain.
They reported that, although they had studied some English in Spain, they were not able to maintain a basic conversation in this language.
The participants of this group also speak Catalan. 
We refer to them as monolingual Spanish speakers in the context of this study only for the sake of clarity. 
Importantly, there are no reported differences in the phonetic realization of voice timing between the Spanish and Catalan, nor are there place differences between the coronal stops.

**Bilingual speakers.** The Spanish-English bilinguals (n = `r bi_coronals_n + bi_poa_n`) came from Southern Arizona and Northern Mexico.
There are two samples from this population.
The coronal data set includes `r bi_coronals_n` speakers and the bilabial data set includes `r bi_poa_n` speakers.
The Spanish-English bilinguals were undergraduate students at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona.
The bilinguals were brought up by Spanish-speaking families and were schooled mostly in English.
They reported using English and Spanish daily, both in the classroom as well as with their friends and relatives.

The bilingual participants completed the Bilingual Language Profile [BLP, @Gertken:2014wj] in order to assess language dominance.
The BLP calculates a weighted average of language dominance based on the individual history, use, proficiency, and attitudes of the bilinguals with regard to their languages.
The measure ranges from −218 to 218 with values near the extremes implying dominance in one of the languages.
Values close to 0 are taken as an indication of balanced bilingualism.
In the present study, Spanish was arbitrarily assigned to positive values.
Figure XXX plots language dominance (Panel A) and language use and proficiency data (Panel B) derived from the BLP.
The bilingual group had a mean dominance score of X (SD = X), suggesting rather balanced bilingualism (Panel A).
Participants that reported using Spanish more often also tended to report being more proficient in that language; the converse was also true for English (Panel B).  
NEED BLP DATA FROM ALDRICH (or something similar). 

## Materials

### Coronal data set

There were `r n_coronal_items - 4` target words (English: k = `r n_coronal_items_en - 4`; Spanish: k = `r n_coronal_items_sp`) that contained voiced and voiceless coronal stops in word initial position.
For each language, 12 targets began with /d/ and 12 began with /t/, equally divided between stressed and unstressed syllables.
All stops were followed by a low vowel (/a/ for Spanish and /æ, ɑ/ for English).

The participants completed a delayed repetition task in which they heard the target words presented in a carrier phrase ("*x is the word*" or the Spanish equivalent "*x es la palabra*").
The auditory stimuli were recordings of 6 male native speakers: 3 native English speakers and 3 native Spanish speakers.
These recordings served as the auditory stimuli repeated out loud by the participants in the delayed repetition task.
Words not containing coronal stops were considered distractors (k = 20).
Praat @praat was used to present the sentences randomly in auditory form and the speakers were asked to listen to the entire sentence and then repeat it out loud at their own pace.

The monolingual English speakers and bilinguals were recorded in a sound attenuated booth.
The monolingual Spanish speakers were recorded in a quiet classroom on the campus of the *Universitat de les Illes Balears* in Majorca, Spain.
The monolingual English speakers were recorded in English and the monolingual Spanish speakers were recorded in Spanish.
The Spanish-English bilinguals were recorded in both of their languages in a single session with all English and Spanish items presented in a single, randomized block.
The full data set included `r n_coronal_possible` tokens (24 target words per language &times; 3 repetitions &times; 25 participant).
`r xfun::numbers_to_words(n_discarded) %>% str_to_sentence` items (`r n_discarded / n_coronal_possible * 100`%) were discarded due to mispronunciations or extraneous noise.
A Shure SM10A dynamic head-mounted microphone with a Sound Devices MM-1 microphone pre-amplifier captured the acoustic signal and it was saved to a Marantz PMD660 digital speech recorder.
The signal was digitized at 44.1 kHz and 16-bit quantization.

### Bilabial data set

INCLUDE INFO FROM ALDRICH's STUDY  

## Metrics

The audio files were low-pass filtered at 11.025 kHz.
Synchronized waveform and spectrographic displays were used to mark the onset of modal voicing and of the stop burst, as well as the offset of the first vowel.
The onset of voicing was operationalized as the upwards zero-crossing of the first periodic pattern in the oscillogram and the offset of the vowel was marked at the downwards zero-crossing of the final periodic pattern.
VOT was calculated as the difference (in ms) between the onset of modal voicing and the onset of the burst.
Spectral moment measures were calculated from a 6 ms window beginning at the onset of the burst.
Specifically, we extracted relative center of gravity, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, as well as F1 and F2 of the following vowel and relative intensity.

## Procedure

I DONT HAVE THIS INFO. NEED FOR BOTH DATA SETS

## Statistical analyses

All analyses were conducted in `R` [@R-base, `r r_version`].
We use Bayesian multilevel models fitted in `Stan` using `brms` [@R-brms_a; @R-brms_b, `r brms_version`].[^1]
For all models, the criterion was standardized, or converted to z-scores, in order to facilitate comparability between metrics.
Continuous predictors were also standardized and categorical predictors were sum-to-zero coded.
Thus for all models the intercept represents the outcome variable at the grand mean in standardized units.
We used regularizing, weakly informative priors in all models (specifics below) with 4,000 iterations (2,000 warm-up) running on 16 processing cores.
We quantify our uncertainty regarding a given effect by reporting point estimates derived from the posterior predictive distribution, including the 95% Highest Density Credible Intervals (HDI).
Additionally, we assume a negligible effect size of &pm;0.1 [@cohen1988statistical; @cohen2013statistical; @kruschke2018rejecting] in order to establish a Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE), for which we assess the proportion of the HDI that falls within this interval.
Finally, we report the Maximum Probability of Effect (MPE), or the Probability of Direction, as the proportion of the posterior distribution that is of the median's sign (See Appendix E of the supplementary materials for additional information). 

[^1]: Bayesian Data Analysis (BDA) is an alternative to frequentist statistical analysis. See Appendix E for a brief overview, as well as @van2014bayesian and @vasishth2018bayesian for tutorials and in depth explanations related to BDA in the psychological and speech sciences.

# Results

The results are divided into 3 subsections dealing with (1) monolingual data, (2) bilingual data, and (3) POA data.
Each subsection presents the results of 6 metrics: VOT, relative intensity, center of gravity, kurtosis, standard deviation, and skewness.
Complete model summaries are available in the supplementary materials. 

## Experiment 1: Monolinguals

We modeled VOT and the burst metrics of the coronal data as a function of language (English, Spanish), voicing (/d/, /t/), standardized F1 and F2, and item repetitions.
The model used regularizing, weakly informative priors [@Gelman_2017; @vasishth2018bayesian].
Specifically, all parameters were assumed to be distributed as normal with a standard deviation of 5, i.e., $Normal(\mu = 0$, $\sigma = 5)$.
The standard deviation parameters for random effects and the model residual error (sigma) were truncated to exclude negative values.
@fig-monolinguals plots VOT and the burst metrics as a function of language (English, Spanish) and voicing (/d/, /t/).
For all plots the y-axis represents the outcome variable in standardized units.
The x-axis indicates the language and voiced/voiceless pairs are represented by color.

```

**Voice-onset time.** English stops had higher VOT than Spanish stops `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language", metric = "VOT")` and the voiceless segments had higher VOT than the voiced segments `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Voicing", metric = "VOT")`. 
We also find moderate evidence for an interaction between the two predictors `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language:Voicing", metric = "VOT")`.
Specifically, the voicing difference between Spanish coronals was slightly larger than that of the English coronals. 
VOT did not vary as a function of the formant frequencies of the following vowel (`r report_posterior(prefix = "F1: ", mono_table, param = "F1", metric = "VOT", supress = T)``r report_posterior(prefix = "; F2: ", mono_table, param = "F2", metric = "VOT", supress = T)`).
We also compared the short-lag stops of each language, English /d/ and Spanish /t/, and found no evidence that the segments differed from each other `r report_posterior(post_hoc, param = "mono_dt_between", metric = "VOT")`, as nearly half the HDI fell within the predetermined region of practical equivalence.
The VOT data is plotted in the first panel of @fig-monolinguals.
The complete model summary and the short-lag stop comparison are available in @tbl-mono and @fig-monolinguals-d-t of the supplementary materials.

**Relative intensity.** The relative intensity data is plotted in the top middle panel of @fig-monolinguals.
English and Spanish stops differed little with regard to relative intensity.
The model provided no compelling evidence for a group effect `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language", metric = "RI")`, nor for voicing `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Voicing", metric = "RI")` or F2 effects `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "F2", metric = "RI")`.
The height of the following vowel did appear to modulate relative intensity of the burst to some degree `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "F1", metric = "RI")`, such that higher F1 values were associated with lower relative intensity.
That being said, approximately `r filter(mono_table, Metric == "RI", identifier == "RI_F1") %>% pull(ROPE) * 100`% of the HDI fell within the region of practical equivalence.
Finally, there was no evidence supporting a language &times; voicing interaction `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language:Voicing", metric = "RI")`.

**Center of gravity.** The center of gravity (COG) data is plotted in the first row, third panel of @fig-monolinguals.
English stops had a higher COG than Spanish stops `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language", metric = "COG")`, and, overall, voiceless segments had a higher COG than the voiced segments `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Voicing", metric = "COG")`, however, the two predictors interacted `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language:Voicing", metric = "COG")`.
The interaction was driven by a large COG difference between Spanish coronals `r report_posterior(prefix = "Spanish /d/ vs. Spanish /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "mono_dt_win_lang", metric = "SPANISH_COG")` that was not present in the English coronals `r report_posterior(prefix = "English /d/ vs. English /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "mono_dt_win_lang", metric = "ENGLISH_COG")`).
No other predictors had an effect on COG.

**Kurtosis.** The kurtosis data is plotted in the second row, first column of @fig-monolinguals.
English stop bursts had lower kurtosis with regard to Spanish stop bursts `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language", metric = "KT")`, and the voiced segments presumably had a higher kurtosis than the voiceless segments `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Voicing", metric = "KT")`, though there was evidence of a language &times; voicing interaction `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language:Voicing", metric = "KT")`.
Specifically, kurtosis was higher in the voiced stop bursts of Spanish `r report_posterior(prefix = "Spanish /d/ vs. Spanish /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "mono_dt_win_lang", metric = "SPANISH_KT")`, but there was no evidence of a voicing difference in the English data `r report_posterior(prefix = "English /d/ vs. English /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "mono_dt_win_lang", metric = "ENGLISH_KT")`.
Neither F1 `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "F1", metric = "KT")` nor F2 `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "F2", metric = "KT")` had any influence on kurtosis.

**Standard deviation.** With regard to standard deviation, we observe the same pattern found in the COG data (See third panel, first row and second panel, second row in @fig-monolinguals).
That is, there was a difference between English and Spanish `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language", metric = "SD")`, as well as between voiced and voiceless segments `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Voicing", metric = "SD")`, though, again, the two predictors interacted `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language:Voicing", metric = "SD")`.
Specifically, there was only a voicing difference for Spanish `r report_posterior(prefix = "Spanish /d/ vs. Spanish /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "mono_dt_win_lang", metric = "SPANISH_SD")`, where we see lower standard deviation values in voiced stops.
No such difference is observed between the English coronals `r report_posterior(prefix = "English /d/ vs. English /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "mono_dt_win_lang", metric = "ENGLISH_SD")`.
Height and frontedness of the following vowel had no effect on standard deviation in the stop burst (`r report_posterior(prefix = "F1: ", mono_table, param = "F1", metric = "SD", supress = T)``r report_posterior(prefix = "; F2: ", mono_table, param = "F2", metric = "SD", supress = T)`).

**Skewness.** The analysis of skewness of the stop burst showed a similar pattern as the one observed in the analysis of kurtosis.
If we compare the first and third panels (second row) of @fig-monolinguals, we observe a language effect `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language", metric = "SK")`, such that Spanish stops show higher skewness values, as well a voicing effect `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Voicing", metric = "SK")`, which is driven by a language &times; voicing interaction `r report_posterior(mono_table, param = "Language:Voicing", metric = "SK")`.
Specifically, the Spanish voiced coronal had higher skewness of the burst than the voiceless counterpart `r report_posterior(prefix = "Spanish /d/ vs. Spanish /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "mono_dt_win_lang", metric = "SPANISH_SK")`, and this difference is not present in the English data `r report_posterior(prefix = "English /d/ vs. English /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "mono_dt_win_lang", metric = "ENGLISH_SK")`.
Again, F1 and F2 did not affect skewness values in the burst (`r report_posterior(prefix = "F1: ", mono_table, param = "F1", metric = "SK", supress = T)``r report_posterior(prefix = "; F2: ", mono_table, param = "F2", metric = "SK", supress = T)`).


**Interim discussion.**

```{r}
#| label: fig-monolinguals-summary
#| fig-cap: "Posterior medians ±95% and 66% credible intervals for VOT and burst metrics of monolingual coronal stops. Individual point shapes and colors represent the six metrics analyzed. In this analysis, 'group' indicates between-language comparisons of different speakers."

include_graphics(here("figs", "mono_summary.pdf"))
```

The analyses of the monolingual coronal stops are summarized in the forest plot in @fig-monolinguals-summary and @tbl-mono of the supplementary materials. 
Unsurprisingly, VOT was realized in a language-specific manner. 
Spanish voiced and voiceless stops were produced with lead-VOT and short-lag VOT, respectively; English voiced and voiceless stops were produced with short-lag VOT and long-lag VOT, respectively. 
Relative intensity did not distinguish between voicing contrasts in either language. 
Spectral moments, on the other hand, were particularly useful for Spanish coronals. 
As shown in @fig-monolinguals, all metrics, with the exception of relative intensity, could be used to differentiate between Spanish voiced and voiceless segments (See also @fig-mono-post-hoc-sm and @tbl-mono-post-hoc-sm of the supplementary materials). 
Skewness and kurtosis patterned similarly, as did COG and standard deviation. 
The spectral moments did not vary as a function of voicing for the English coronals. 

## Experiment 2: Bilinguals

For the analysis of the bilingual coronal data, we again modeled VOT and the burst metrics as a function of language (English, Spanish), voicing (/d/, /t/), standardized F1 and F2, and item repetitions. 
In other words, we carried out the same analysis using data from bilingual individuals. 
In this case, however, the fixed effect *language* is a within-participant factor. 
That is, the bilinguals provided data from each of their two languages. 
@fig-bilinguals plots VOT and the burst metrics as a function of language (English, Spanish) and voicing (/d/, /t/).
For all plots, the y-axis represents the outcome variable in standardized units, the x-axis indicates the language, and voicing is represented by color.

```{r}

include_graphics(here("figs", "bi_all_metrics.pdf"))
```

**Voice-onset time.** VOT for English stops was higher than for Spanish stops `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "Language", metric = "VOT")`, as was the case for voiceless segments in comparison with voiced segments `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "Voicing", metric = "VOT")`.
The two predictors did not interact `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "Language:Voicing", metric = "VOT")`.
Upon comparing the short-lag stops of each language, English /d/ and Spanish /t/, we found minimal evidence that the segments differed from each other `r report_posterior(post_hoc, param = "bi_dt_between", metric = "VOT")`. 
Approximately 12% of the HDI fell within the predetermined region of practical equivalence, though given the model, the data, and our prior assumptions, there is a 97% chance the effect is negative, i.e., that English /d/ has lower VOT than Spanish /t/. 
This is likely due to the bilinguals' tendency to pre-voice in English.
The VOT data is plotted in the first panel of @fig-bilinguals.
The complete model summary and the short-lag stop comparison are available in @tbl-bi and @fig-bilinguals-d-t of the supplementary materials.

**Relative intensity.** We plot the relative intensity data in the top middle panel of @fig-bilinguals.
There was no evidence for a group effect `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "Language", metric = "RI")`, nor for voicing `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "Voicing", metric = "RI")` or F2 `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "F2", metric = "RI")`.
We found a relationship between height of the following vowel and relative intensity of the burst  `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "F1", metric = "RI")`. 
Concretely, higher F1 values were associated with lower relative intensity.
There was no evidence supporting a language &times; voicing interaction `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "Language:Voicing", metric = "RI")`.


**Center of gravity.** COG was higher in English stops than in Spanish stops `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "Language", metric = "COG")`. 
Voiceless segments had higher COG than the voiced segments `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "Voicing", metric = "COG")`. 
We found weak evidence for a language &times; voicing interaction `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "Language:Voicing", metric = "COG")`.
The difference between voiced and voiceless coronals was slightly larger in Spanish than it was in English. 
No other predictors had an effect on COG. 
The COG data is plotted in the first row, third panel of @fig-bilinguals.


**Kurtosis.** We plot the kurtosis data in the second row, first column of @fig-bilinguals. 
Kurtosis was higher in English stop bursts than Spanish stop bursts `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "Language", metric = "KT")`, and also in voiced segments `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "Voicing", metric = "KT")`, though there was a language &times; voicing interaction `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "Language:Voicing", metric = "KT")`.
In this case, we observed that kurtosis was higher in the voiced stop bursts of Spanish `r report_posterior(prefix = "Spanish /d/ vs. Spanish /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "bi_dt_win_lang", metric = "SPANISH_KT")`, but the voicing difference was much smaller in the English data `r report_posterior(prefix = "English /d/ vs. English /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "bi_dt_win_lang", metric = "ENGLISH_KT")`.
Neither F1 `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "F1", metric = "KT")` nor F2 `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "F2", metric = "KT")` had any influence on kurtosis. 


**Standard deviation.** Regarding standard deviation, we again observe the same pattern found in the COG data (See third panel, first row and second panel, second row in @fig-bilinguals).
In other words, there was a difference between English and Spanish `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "Language", metric = "SD")`, as well as between segments `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "Voicing", metric = "SD")`. 
The estimate for the language &times; voicing interaction falls nearly entirely within our predetermined ROPE, though given the data, the model, and our prior assumptions, there is high probability that the effect it positive `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "Language:Voicing", metric = "SD")`.
Height and frontedness of the following vowel had no effect on standard deviation in the stop burst (`r report_posterior(prefix = "F1: ", bi_table, param = "F1", metric = "SD", supress = T)``r report_posterior(prefix = "; F2: ", bi_table, param = "F2", metric = "SD", supress = T)`).

<!--
`r report_posterior(prefix = "Spanish /d/ vs. Spanish /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "bi_dt_win_lang", metric = "SPANISH_SD")`

`r report_posterior(prefix = "English /d/ vs. English /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "bi_dt_win_lang", metric = "ENGLISH_SD")`
--> 

**Skewness.** With regard to skewness, we again see a similar pattern as the one observed in the analysis of kurtosis (See first and third panels in the second row of @fig-bilinguals). 
We find an effect of language effect `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "Language", metric = "SK")`, such that Spanish stops show higher skewness values, and voicing `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "Voicing", metric = "SK")`, which is driven by a language &times; voicing interaction `r report_posterior(bi_table, param = "Language:Voicing", metric = "SK")`.
The Spanish voiced /d/ had higher skewness than voiceless /t/ `r report_posterior(prefix = "Spanish /d/ vs. Spanish /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "bi_dt_win_lang", metric = "SPANISH_SK")`, and this difference is much smaller in the English data `r report_posterior(prefix = "English /d/ vs. English /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "bi_dt_win_lang", metric = "ENGLISH_SK")`.
Again, F1 and F2 had no affect on skewness (`r report_posterior(prefix = "F1: ", bi_table, param = "F1", metric = "SK", supress = T)``r report_posterior(prefix = "; F2: ", bi_table, param = "F2", metric = "SK", supress = T)`).


**Interim discussion.**

include_graphics(here("figs", "bi_summary.pdf"))
```

The analyses of the bilingual coronal stops are summarized in the forest plot in @fig-bilinguals-summary and @tbl-bi of the supplementary materials.
Again, we see VOT realized in a language-specific manner. 
The bilinguals produced Spanish voiced and voiceless stops with lead-VOT and short-lag VOT, respectively, and the English voiced and voiceless stops with short-lag VOT and long-lag VOT, respectively. 
The voicing contrasts of English and Spanish did not vary based on relative intensity, though all the spectral moments did for the Spanish data. 
Similar to monolingual data, skewness and kurtosis patterned similarly, as did COG and standard deviation. 
In many regards the results of the bilingual analyses were virtually identical to those of the monolingual analyses (compare @fig-monolinguals with @fig-bilinguals); however, we do observe several important differences. 
First, we find more variability overall, i.e., wider posterior distributions, in the bilingual data. 
Second, the bilingual data showed more pre-voicing in English /d/, which was not present to the same extent in the monolingual data.
Finally, small voicing distinctions in four of the spectral moments (center of gravity, standard deviation, skewness, and, to a lesser extent, kurtosis) were present in the bilinguals' production of English coronals. 
@fig-bi-post-hoc-sm plots the posterior distributions of the /d/-/t/ difference estimates for each spectral moment and relative intensity in English and Spanish (See also @tbl-bi-post-hoc-sm of the supplementary materials). 
We see the same general pattern for each language, though the difference estimates are much larger in the Spanish data. 
The bilingual participants appear to have carried over some of the burst characteristics of their Spanish coronals into their English.

## Experiment 3: Bilingual POA data

The final set of analyses compared a subset of the bilingual coronal stop data with bilabial data from a separate group of bilinguals (see Method section). 
We analyzed VOT and the same burst metrics as the previous analyses. 
In this case, however, the outcome variables were modeled as a function of language (English, Spanish), place of articulation (POA: bilabial, coronal), standardized F1 and F2, and item repetitions. 
We only included the voiceless stops (/p/, /t/) from each language. 
Importantly, the fixed effect *POA* is a between-participant factor. 
That is, one set of bilingual individuals provided the bilabial data in English and Spanish, and another set of bilingual individuals (those from the previous experiment) provided the coronal data in English and Spanish. 
@fig-poa-bilinguals plots VOT and the burst metrics as a function of language (English, Spanish) and POA (bilabial, coronal). 
For all plots, the y-axis represents the outcome variable in standardized units, the x-axis represents POA, and language is represented by color.

**Voice-onset time.** The VOT data is plotted in the first panel of @fig-poa-bilinguals.
The complete model summary is available in @fig-poa-bilinguals-summary below, as well as @tbl-bi-poa of the supplementary materials.
There was a strong effect of language `r report_posterior(bi_poa_table, param = "Language", metric = "VOT")`. 
English voiceless stops had higher VOT than Spanish voiceless stops regardless of POA `r report_posterior(bi_poa_table, param = "Place", metric = "VOT")`. 
We did not find compelling evidence for a language &times; POA interaction `r report_posterior(bi_poa_table, param = "Language:Place", metric = "VOT")`, nor were there any effects for the formant structure of the following vowel (`r report_posterior(prefix = "F1: ", bi_poa_table, param = "F1", metric = "VOT", supress = T)``r report_posterior(prefix = "; F2: ", bi_poa_table, param = "F2", metric = "VOT", supress = T)`). 


**Relative intensity.** Relative intensity of the burst was slightly higher in English than in Spanish `r report_posterior(bi_poa_table, param = "Language", metric = "RI")`, though nearly half of the posterior mass fell within our pre-established region of practical equivalence. 
Relative intensity was higher in bilabial stops than in coronals stops `r report_posterior(bi_poa_table, param = "Place", metric = "RI")`. 
The two predictors did not interact `r report_posterior(bi_poa_table, param = "Language:Place", metric = "RI")`. 
We found evidence for a relationship between height of the following vowel and relative intensity of the burst `r report_posterior(bi_poa_table, param = "F1", metric = "RI")`. 
Concretely, higher F1 values were associated with lower relative intensity. 
There was no evidence suggesting frontedness of the following vowel had any effect `r report_posterior(bi_poa_table, param = "F2", metric = "RI")`. 
The relative intensity data is plotted in the second panel of @fig-poa-bilinguals and the complete model summary is available in @fig-poa-bilinguals-summary or @tbl-bi-poa of the supplementary materials.


**Center of gravity.** There was an effect of language `r report_posterior(bi_poa_table, param = "Language", metric = "COG")` and POA `r report_posterior(bi_poa_table, param = "Place", metric = "COG")` and the two predictors interacted `r report_posterior(bi_poa_table, param = "Language:Place", metric = "COG")`. 
As illustrated in the third panel of @fig-poa-bilinguals, COG was higher in English /t/ than in Spanish /t/ `r report_posterior(prefix = "Spanish /t/ vs. English /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "bi_poa_between_lang", metric = "CORONAL_COG")`, but there was no such difference in the bilabials `r report_posterior(prefix = "Spanish /p/ vs. English /p/: ", post_hoc, param = "bi_poa_between_lang", metric = "BILABIAL_COG")`. 
The following vowel did not affect COG of the bursts (`r report_posterior(prefix = "F1: ", bi_poa_table, param = "F1", metric = "COG", supress = T)``r report_posterior(prefix = "; F2: ", bi_poa_table, param = "F2", metric = "COG", supress = T)`). 
The model summary is presented in the forest plot in @fig-poa-bilinguals-summary and in @tbl-bi-poa of the supplementary materials. 


**Kurtosis.** There was an effect of language `r report_posterior(bi_poa_table, param = "Language", metric = "KT")` and POA `r report_posterior(bi_poa_table, param = "Place", metric = "KT")` and the two predictors interacted `r report_posterior(bi_poa_table, param = "Language:Place", metric = "KT")`. 
As illustrated in the first panel of the second row in @fig-poa-bilinguals, kurtosis was higher in Spanish /t/ than in English /t/ `r report_posterior(prefix = "Spanish /t/ vs. English /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "bi_poa_between_lang", metric = "CORONAL_KT")`, but there was no such difference in the bilabials `r report_posterior(prefix = "Spanish /p/ vs. English /p/: ", post_hoc, param = "bi_poa_between_lang", metric = "BILABIAL_KT")`. 
The following vowel did not affect kurtosis in the bursts (`r report_posterior(prefix = "F1: ", bi_poa_table, param = "F1", metric = "KT", supress = T)``r report_posterior(prefix = "; F2: ", bi_poa_table, param = "F2", metric = "KT", supress = T)`). 
The model summary is available in @fig-poa-bilinguals-summary (See also @tbl-bi-poa of the supplementary materials). 


**Standard deviation.** Similar to the COG and kurtosis analyses, we again see an effect of language `r report_posterior(bi_poa_table, param = "Language", metric = "SD")` and POA `r report_posterior(bi_poa_table, param = "Place", metric = "SD")` and the two predictors interacted `r report_posterior(bi_poa_table, param = "Language:Place", metric = "SD")`. 
As illustrated in the middle panel of the second row in @fig-poa-bilinguals, standard deviation was higher in English /t/ than in Spanish /t/ `r report_posterior(prefix = "Spanish /t/ vs. English /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "bi_poa_between_lang", metric = "CORONAL_SD")`, but there was no such difference in the bilabials `r report_posterior(prefix = "Spanish /p/ vs. English /p/: ", post_hoc, param = "bi_poa_between_lang", metric = "BILABIAL_SD")`. 
The following vowel did not affect standard deviation of the bursts (`r report_posterior(prefix = "F1: ", bi_poa_table, param = "F1", metric = "SD", supress = T)``r report_posterior(prefix = "; F2: ", bi_poa_table, param = "F2", metric = "SD", supress = T)`). 
The model summary is available in @fig-poa-bilinguals-summary, as well as @tbl-bi-poa of the supplementary materials. 


**Skewness.** Finally, for skewness we find an effect of language `r report_posterior(bi_poa_table, param = "Language", metric = "SK")` and POA `r report_posterior(bi_poa_table, param = "Place", metric = "SK")` and the two predictors interacted `r report_posterior(bi_poa_table, param = "Language:Place", metric = "SK")`. 
As illustrated in the final panel of the second row in @fig-poa-bilinguals, skewness was higher in Spanish /t/ than in English /t/ `r report_posterior(prefix = "Spanish /t/ vs. English /t/: ", post_hoc, param = "bi_poa_between_lang", metric = "CORONAL_SK")`, but there was no such difference in the bilabials `r report_posterior(prefix = "Spanish /p/ vs. English /p/: ", post_hoc, param = "bi_poa_between_lang", metric = "BILABIAL_SK")`. 
The following vowel did not affect skewness of the bursts (`r report_posterior(prefix = "F1: ", bi_poa_table, param = "F1", metric = "SK", supress = T)``r report_posterior(prefix = "; F2: ", bi_poa_table, param = "F2", metric = "SK", supress = T)`).

**Interim discussion.**

#| fig-cap: "Posterior medians ±95% and 66% credible intervals for VOT and burst metrics of bilingual voiceless bilabial and coronal stops. Individual point shapes and colors represent the six metrics analyzed.

The analyses of the bilingual bilabial and coronal voiceless stops are summarized in the forest plot in @fig-poa-bilinguals-summary and @tbl-bi-poa of the supplementary materials.
The analyses revealed four important findings. 
First, VOT was realized in a language-specific manner that was was similar for bilabials and coronals. 
As with the previous analyses, Spanish voiceless stops were realized with short-lag VOT and English voiceless stops were realized with long-lag VOT. 
Second, relative intensity can capture place of articulation differences, which are realized similarly in English and Spanish. 
Third, we again find that COG and standard deviation pattern similarly, as do kurtosis and skewness, across languages for bilabial and coronal stops. 
And, finally, we see that English and Spanish coronals differ with regard to all four spectral moment measurements, where as bilabials do not. 
@fig-poa-post-hoc-all plots the posterior distributions of the Spanish-English difference estimates for VOT, relative intensity, and each spectral moment for bilabials and coronals (See also @tbl-poa-post-hoc-all). 
One can observe clear between language differences for VOT in bilabials and coronals (i.e., short-lag vs. long-lag realizations), but only for coronals (orange triangles) in the spectral moments. 
Thus, all four spectal moment measurements capture the subtle articulatory differences (dental vs. alveolar) between English and Spanish coronals stops. 
No such fine-phonetic differences are attested in bilabials, and, unsurprisingly, we find no between-language differences at bilabial place.
