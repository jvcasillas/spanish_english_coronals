# Production

## Questions 

1. How does linguistic experience affect coronal production? 
Do bilinguals distinguish between Spanish and English coronals using acoustic correlates other than VOT?
	- English coronals
		- Compare /d/ and /t/ of English (NEN, biEng, biEsp) (VOT, SD, COG)
		- Results
			- Group differences for /d/... vot decreases from mono avg with increased dominance in spanish 
				- likely due to increased amount of prevoiced /d/ (more prevoicing w/ increased dominance in spanish)
			- Groups distinguish between /d/-/t/ using sd (no group differences)
			- all three groups distinguish between /d/-/t/ using cog (no group differences)
	- Spanish coronals
		- Compare /d/ and /t/ of Spanish (NSP, biEng, biEsp) (VOT, SD, COG)
		- Results
			- 3 groups distinguish between /d/-/t/ using vot
			- 3 groups distinguish between /d/-/t/ using SD 
				- marginal effect, more spread (higher avg) for /t/
			- Group differences for cog... bilinguals differ from monolingual control
				- more english dominance = larger difference (more instances of larger circles)

2. Do bilinguals maintain separate coronal segments for English and for Spanish?
	- Compare Spanish /t/ with English /d/ (biEng, biEsp) (VOT, SD, COG)
	- Results
		- vot
			- No group differences between spanish /t/ and english /d/
			- but two phones are significantly different from each other
			- spanish /t/ has higher VOT; english /d/ has lower VOT
			- likely due to bilingual tendency to prevoice english /d/
			- maybe burst differences due to POA as well
		- sd
			- No group differences; but spanish /t/ is different from english /d/
			- likely reflects POA differences
		- cog
			- No group differences (interaction due to direction of change between group)
			- however both groups maintain distinction between spanish /t/ and english /d/
			- likely related to POA differences

- Metrics
	- VOT
	- Standard Deviation
	- Center of Gravity
